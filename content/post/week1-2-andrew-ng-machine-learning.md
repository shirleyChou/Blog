#### what is machine learning?

* **DEFINITION**: Tom Mitchell (1998) Well-posed Learning Problem: A computer program is said to learn from **experience E** with respect to some **task T** and some **performance measure P**, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.
* **EXAMPLE**: Suppose your email program watches which emails you do or do not mark as spam, and based on that learns how to better filter spam. What is the task T in this setting?
  * Classifying emails as spam or not spam ( **T** )
  * Watching you label emails as spam or not spam ( **E** )
  * The number (or fraction) of emails correctly classified as spam/not spam ( **P** )



#### Several types of machine learning algorithms

> 

* **Supervised Learning**
  * Teach the computer how to do something.
* **Unsupervised Learning**
  * Let the computer learn how to do something by thenselves.
* **Reinforcement learning**
* **Semi-supervised Learning**
